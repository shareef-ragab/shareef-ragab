## Hi  ðŸ‘‹

# SHAREEF RAJAB ,
### DEVELOPER 

I am Shareef Rajab, a graduate in the field of computer science at the Faculty of Information Technology
from the Gaza University ... 

I have agreat passion for learning computer technologies and the programs used in them and I have a great ambition
to be one of the flags of this specialization in the universe. I liked this major from a young age, as I started saving 
to buy computers and start learning on computers. I bought computers in ninth grade and started learning from government curricula. 

I was not familiar with and directing computer fields. I was in a maze because of the lack of proper
guidance and guidance, but I did not give up. I was convinced by the saying, "Don't give me a fish, teach
me how to fish." At first, it was not my interest to learn money. I was developing my skills for fun until I graduated from high school. 


The change has happened here as I've lost much of my skills from what  
I've learned in the past, motivated me to learn new things and enter into a computer major, 
and you have chosen me to be a leader in computer science. I was not satisfied with knowing that the university provided me, 
so I tried to find resources to learn the other
